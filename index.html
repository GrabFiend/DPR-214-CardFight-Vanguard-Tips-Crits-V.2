									<h2>Royal Paladin</h2>
									<p>Royal's Paladin main goal is achieve overwhelming force. They use superior calling effects to quickly gather 5 rear-guards, and gain advantages and power from those rear-guards. The Altmile archetype has an added focus on calling Grade 2 rearguards, calling during the Battle Phase to do additional attacks, and using the Keyword "Brave" which unlocks powerful effects when the player has three or less cards in hand. The "Sanctuary Guard" archetype on the other hand power up their front row for each Grade 1 rear-guard they have.</p>

									<h2>Shadow Paladin</h2>
									<p>Shadow Paladin's goal is to sacrifice your own units for achieve abilities and such. It focus on calling rear-guards from the deck, but unlike Royal Paladin who gains power from rear-guards, Shadow Paladin retires their rear-guards for costs or effects. It uses superior calling and building hand advantage to recover from the losses of retiring many rear-guards. With the newly added "Luard" archetype, Shadow Paladin now focuses on calling grade 1 cards in contrast to Royal Paladin calling grade 2 cards, and also introduces rear-guards whose effects activate when retired for your costs. The keyword "Ritual" activates based on the number of grade 1 cards in your drop zone.</p>

									<h2>Gold Paladin</h2>
									<p>Originally, Gold Paladin's ability to superior call was restricted to one card from the top deck. Counting a few previous cards, this was further expanded upon in the Legion era, where the new effects allow the player to search the top three to five cards of their deck and chose one from among them to superior call. This ability later becomes the main playstyle of Gold Paladin in Cardfight!! Vanguard G, specifically with the Gurguit archetype, that also gives power to their units using the keyword "Unite". The clan can also superior call units from the deck into the guardian circle.</p>

									<h2>Kagero</h2>
									<p>Kagero's goal is to burn opponent's resources. The main way they do this is by retiring the opponent's rear-guards to gain advantages and weaken, or outright ruin, the opponent's battle formation. The "Blaze" keyword, primarily used by the Blademaster series, activates if the player has more rear-guards than the opponent.</p>

									<h2>Narukami</h2>
									<p>Narukami's focuses on retiring the opponent's rear-guards to some extent, from actual retiring  or gaining the ability to attack multiple units, causing the opponent to guard each unit or lose those who remain unguarded. Narukami recently gained the ability to bind units starting in Cardfight!! Vanguard G. Some units can retire an opponent's rear-guard, and then bind said card once it enters the Drop Zone, while some cards can bind a card directly from the Drop Zone. The cards are bound face up, and the binds are permanent and fuel the clan's keyword "Thunderstrike", which allows units to gain power and effects depending on the number of cards in the opponent's Bind Zone.</p>

									<h2>Dimension Police</h2>
									<p>The Justice of Dimension Police are focused around powering up their vanguard , their keyword "Burst" is triggered upon having a certain amount of power before the attack step; usually, these skills involve an increase in criticals. The villains of Dimension Police reduce the power of your opponent's vanguard, making it easier for their units to deal damage and gaining benefits if the vanguard has 8000 or less power. Dimension Police features effects that retire the opponent's guardians to make it even harded to block their high powered Vanguard attacks.</p>
